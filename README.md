# Brain Health Classification Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Brain Health Classification Project README! This project focuses on the development of a machine learning model aimed at classifying two significant brain diseases: Brain Tumours and Alzheimer's Disease. By utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to provide an efficient tool for early diagnosis and intervention, ultimately enhancing healthcare outcomes and improving the quality of life for individuals affected by these conditions.

## Project Overview

### Objective

The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine-learning model capable of accurately classifying brain diseases based on medical imaging data. Specifically, our model distinguishes between different types of brain tumours (Pituitary Tumours, Meningiomas, Gliomas, and No-Tumour) and categorizes Alzheimer's Disease into four stages (Very Mild Dementia, Mild Dementia, Moderate Dementia, and Non-Demented).

### Dataset

We utilize two distinct datasets for training and evaluation purposes. The first dataset comprises approximately 7,100 brain images for Brain Tumour classification, while the second dataset consists of 5,000 images for Alzheimer's Disease classification. These datasets provide a diverse range of samples necessary for training a robust and generalizable model.

### Model Architecture

Our machine learning model is built upon state-of-the-art deep learning architectures tailored for image classification tasks. By leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and transfer learning techniques, we ensure efficient feature extraction and high classification accuracy.

### Input and Output

The model accepts input in the form of JPEG or PNG images, typically MRI scans of the brain. Upon processing the input image, the model provides a classification output indicating the type of disease the person may be suffering from. This output facilitates early detection and personalized treatment strategies.

## Usage

To utilize the trained model for disease classification, follow these steps:

1. **Input Image**: Provide a JPEG or PNG image containing a brain scan (e.g., MRI scan).

2. **Model Prediction**: Submit the input image to the trained model.

3. **Output**: Receive a classification output indicating the type of brain disease detected (e.g., Pituitary Tumour, Alzheimer's Disease - Mild Dementia).

## Conclusion

The Brain Health Classification Project represents a significant advancement in medical imaging and diagnosis. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we aim to address the challenge of brain disease classification, thereby enhancing early detection and improving healthcare outcomes. This project holds immense potential for application in neurology and beyond, contributing to improved healthcare and overall quality of life for individuals worldwide.
